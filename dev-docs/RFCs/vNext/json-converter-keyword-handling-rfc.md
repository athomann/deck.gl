# RFC: Syntactic sugar for @deck.gl/json

* **Authors**: Andrew Duberstein (@ajduberstein)
* **Date**: October 10, 2019
* **Status**: Draft


## Overview

This is a proposal for adding syntactic sugar to the @deck.gl/json expression parser which will let the user distinguish
between the keyword `type` and a string named `type`.


## Motivation

The keyword `type` occurs as a field name in many data sets, and is also of course a Javascript keyword.
Users may want "type" to be interpreted as one or the other but currently can't specify which.

The GeoJSON standard includes type in the top-level JSON, so most GeoJSON data sets break when ingested by the deck.gl/json API.

## Proposal

Suggestions from @ibgreenâ€“

Use `__type` to indicate the Javascript `type` keyword.

Additionally, add a syntax for expressions, e.g, @= prefix: @=[lng, lat], so that we didn't need to know any information about
prop types to deduce which strings to parse as expressions.
